**DISCLAIMER** the text below discusses terrorism, civil rights, and some topics sensitive to some people. If you are not comfortable with that, this scenario might not be for you.

The melting point is a complete cinematic scenario for Alien roleplaying game.
The setup is quite straightforward: Weyland-Yutani Pallas refinery station operates under United Americas surveillance. 
The corporation provides technical knowhow while the government provides labor force in the form of captured terrorists. 
Terrorists awake from crio-sleep and must perform heavy duties while some of them plot a scheme to escape the refinery.
A standard annual inspection brings an unintended passenger and hell cuts lose as the station enters quarantine. 
What will the station crew do? Will the prisoners ally or will old grudges turn them one against the others?

Many of the prisioners at Pallas never faced trial or charges, they were caught under the United America terrorist act and send to prison where they could be held for at most 1 year. However, lack of communication, time for lawyer to travel to the place, and all the corporate bureaucracy has made the location a living nightmare.  

I will try to write this scenario so people can play it from two different perspectives: corporate crew & prisoners


## Characters


**Prisoners**

**Why the prisoners don't just blow up the place?** Well, truth to be told most of them are indeed terrorists and they have plans to either escape, gain control of the station a new rendezvous point, or take revenge on both United Americas or  Weyland-Yutani. Let's just all accept any plausible excuses and have some fun playing RPG. 

* **Andy Myers**, "kid": a drug dealer. You have dwarfism and, over the years, you learned how to use this so that you passed unnoticed through marshals and law enforcement. 
* **Fredy Cooperr**, officer: one of the most fearsome terrorists on anchor point station 2. You fought against corporate greed and blew several Weyland-Yutani installations before arrest. 
* **Henrique Santiago**, pilot smuggler: you trafficked people for organs extraction. It suffices to say that your lack any moral restraints.
* **Hite Chyio**, company agent: you were a Yakuza boss. You have blackmail information on several politicians and Weyland-Yutani. Kathia Rison is on her way to get you out of this hell. 
* **Ivan Beschastnikh**, marine: "dishonorably discharged" you do not talk about the reason why they threw you in this place either as a punishment worst than death or as a last favor. You are simply ruthless and think that in 3 to 6 months you will be back in the military under some black-ops team.
* **Jone Heson**, roughneck: you were wrongly accused for a crime you did not commit. You are a hardworking person and you had hopes that Weyland-Yutani lawyers would reach out and save you. Until then, you have to blend in and survive.
* **Nolan Alder**, scientist: a bio-terrorist. Before being caught, you left a sample of Chemical Agent A0-3959X.91â€“15 in a hidden stash. You plan to escape and launch a bio attack against anchor point station 2


**Lasalle Bionational crew**

**Aleki Bowman**, marine: chief of security of the Lasalle Bionational crew
**Barby Lopez**, pilot: you brought Kathia on her corporate mission though you know the fame of Pallas and had you had the opportunity, you wouldn't think twice about shutting down the place
**Kathia Rison**, company agent: on your way to extract Hite from Pallas and get the hell out of this god forsaken place
**Tery Marte**, roughneck reporter: an activist, you have a hidden camera in your right arm and you falsified paperwork to present yourself as a psychologist. You plan to evaluate the prisoners as an excuse to get first hand data on Pallas and use that for blackmailing or to shut the place down

**Pallas crew**

(will get back and update this)

**Joyce Ardson**, roughneck: the chief engineer of the station
**Victor Macbeth**, medic: chief medic on the station
**Mik Elson**, marine: chief of security
**Abdul Mageed**, colonial marshal: a pragmatic. You run the entire station making sure that prisoners don't kill each other (more than the necessary to blow steam off). You turn a blind-eye to people wrongly accused thinking that the few false positives justify all the greater good.


## Act 1


Pallas is a lithium refinery. The ore is extracted in the mining section and sent via pipes for processing. 



**Science Background:** Lithium is a highly reactive alkali metal that offers excellent heat and electrical conductivity.  These properties make it particularly useful for the manufacture of glass, high-temperature lubricants, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and lithium ion batteries for electric cars and consumer electronics

The process for recovering lithium from ore can vary based on the specific mineral deposit in question. In general, the process entails removing the mineral material from the earth then heating and pulverizing it. The crushed mineral powder is combined with chemical reactants, such as sulfuric acid, then the slurry is heated, filtered, and concentrated through an evaporation process to form saleable lithium carbonate, while the resulting wastewater is treated for reuse or disposal.


It operate on a cryosleep round robin algorithm, i.e., to avoid riots only a handful prisoners are awake at any given time. Other cryosleep chambers are heavily protected and out of limits. Prisoners awake from cryosleep and start the refinery work. 

At each round robin rotation, a synthetic is put alongside the prisoners so that it can gather data about potential terrorist attacks and evidence that can serve for blackmailing purposes. Some prisoners heard rumors about that.

___

Corporate people arrive at the station and Kathia wants to bring Hite back to Lasalle Bionational territory. She speaks with the station marshal Abdul Mageed and is allowed to take the elevator down to refinery levels where she can talk with the prisoner. Three more people go with her to ensure her security (Mik and Victor) or to play some role in the extraction (Tery and Aleki). 


Roll events as potential introductions and negotiation for the Lasalle and Pallas crews. If you plan to run the adventure using the crew make sure that either no one follows Kathia to prison OR that players are equally divided between station and prison levels.


For the prisoners, keep them busy dividing them either at the mining area or the refinery area.

-- There is a solar glass panel that is not protecting against ultraviolet radiation in the refinery. Part of the crew should fix that. An entire shift can fix a small portion of the panel but not everything. This will have a role later on.

-- Rumors spread that there is a synthetic amongst the prisoners and people plot how to rule out who is the synthetic to feed misinformation to it 

### Quarantine lock-down

Within some of the lithium ore, there are parasites created by the engineers. When the ore is heat and pulverized in the refinery section, a small parcel of the parasites spread through the station ducts. Two will make their way to hosts in the refinery section while a third one will infect someone at the crew quarters. 

The Pallas computer system, **Dexter**, warns about environmental hazard contamination and puts the station in lock-down. Increase stress level by 1

**The setup:** the only person with a corporate key card is at the prison (Kathia). The card is necessary to turn the engines of the Lasalle Bionational back online if anyone plans to escape. The keycard is in Kathia's possession or locked under some biometric safe with instructions to corrupt the card if anyone tries to crack it open. 

It's also necessary to open the landing hatch. Potential solutions involve using the sulfuric acid in the refinery or blowing the thing open. Either option will take the air out of the refinery and if done before the keycard is retrieved, that will put everything on a timer before. I advise to run for air supply at every hour instead of every turn.



### Planning how to escape

Lock-down won't let the elevator between the levels work until environment measurements are back to standard levels.


The prisoners can check air filters at several locations to make sure the measurements are not just malfunctioning. This in fact is not the first time that something similar has happened. 


Meanwhile one of the infected will start having convulsions and a spidery like being will pop out of the person's back. 
You can run this through multiple stages: 

- 1st convulsions and med bay
- 2nd splitting blood and more seizures
- 3rd alien pops our

The alien is quite different. It's parasitic. It is still feeding from the host and using its locomotion capabilities while it grows stronger. At this stage, players can see a protuberance in the person's back, broken bones, and four long and thin spider-like appendages appear in the host's back. The creature uses these sharp appendages to attack and kill potential threats and to infect new victims. 

Increase stress level by one again. If attacked and threatened, the creature can detach from the host and escape thorough a duct. 

Kathia will persuade the prisoners to safeguard her and take her out of the station. Any prisoners protecting her will receive new identities in Lasalle Bionational controlled space.
