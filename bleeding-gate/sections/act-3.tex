\chapter{Act III}



\begin{rpg-commentbox}{Meat Grinder}

\texttt{\textbf{MU/TH/UR:}} The alien that got the pilot and caused the incident is now back on its feet and has joined the other alien on its hunt. 
If the other alien has died, this one is badder and meaner! If the alien in act 2 has been trapped or presumably killed and you want to spicy things up, just make it escape its entrapment or heal its injuries so that you have 2 aliens in act 3.

\end{rpg-commentbox}    


\begin{rpg-commentbox}{We have our orders}

\texttt{\textbf{MU/TH/UR:}} A fire squad of 3 mercenaries are guarding the entrance. They act in interest of Weyland-Yutani. Their rounds are filled with an expansive muscle inhibitor gel. Ideally, they want to neutralize the alien without killing it. The idea is to neutralize both the firefighters and the aliens and take them captive to study the creature and, at the same time, get rid of any eye-witnesses. 

A player hit by this bullets must succeed on a \texttt{\textbf{STAMINA}} roll or fall unconscious for a shift. Apply a \texttt{\textbf{-1}} penalty to the roll for every point of damage after the first one.
The same applies for the alien, but only if it is below half its total health.

If some of the players have died in the previous acts, let them assume one of the Weyland-Yutani mercenaries role.
\end{rpg-commentbox}   


\begin{rpg-commentbox}{Why risk entering the medical facility?}

\texttt{\textbf{MU/TH/UR:}} While Weyland-Yutani had clearance to the VIP medical room, they do not control de facility and either the United Americas or the 3-World-Empire can soon catch-up with their shenanigans. Their two options are destroying all evidence related to the alien, or retrieve the creature and use any eye-witness for further lab tests. As a corporation, they have already invested too much money to pull the medical surgery that started it all and they don't want to leave empty handed.

\begin{rpg-commentbox}{Ok what we got here?}
\texttt{\textbf{MU/TH/UR:}} Give the players some room to discuss how they want to approach the entrance. 
Similar to Act 2, this represents a 3 to 5 minutes (in game) conversation, but more than that and the steps from the alien will get louder and they will need to move. Note that this is mostly for drama purposes, but the alien will jump back to the ventilation system and see if it can get the firefighters by surpirse.

Some suggestions on how the players can engage in conversations with the marshal's fire team are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Classical conversation behind cover; Players want to make sure that they can escape and that the soldiers are there to protect them. What will make the players on their toes here is the fact that the alien(s) can appear any moment anywhere.
    \item Players send a single ``embassator'' to parley. Ideally they have something up on their sleeve that can bring them some advantage.
    \item Players send the alien as an ``embassator''. Well, they can't shoot at you if they are busy with the alien. 
    \item Players devise some strategy to cause a reaction near the entrance and use that as a distraction to escape.
\end{enumerate}

\end{rpg-commentbox}



\section{Negotiations}

\begin{rpg-commentbox}{The fire squad}
   Use the NPC sheets avaiable on Chapter 2. There are 3 Weyland-Yutani mercenaries in the entrace. Two behind the crates near each one of the walls near the exit and a third behind the door that gives access to the cantina. The leader, who is in the cantina, wants to convince the firefighters to move into the open (\texttt{\textbf{MANIPULATION}}) lying to the players to rush and get cover behind them.  
   
   If firefighters belive them, they rush to the corridor in hope of getting cover behind the squad only to be backstabbed. The other two mercenaries will throw an \texttt{\textbf{audio decoy}} (homage to Alien Isolation) which will make enough sound and attract the alien. Jump to alien rampage.

   \texttt{\textbf{MU/TH/UR:}} Remember that the mercenaries are smart. They can perhaps ask the firefighters to move one at a time. For example, one firefighter moves behind the merc in the crate to the right. When the other firefighters decide to move, the merc on the left crate can take care of the firefighter already in cover, while the other two focus on full-autoing firefighters or the alien who are in the open.   
\end{rpg-commentbox}


\begin{rpg-commentbox}{We don't trust you}
    If players don't trust the fire squad, they can start negotiating. They will seek some assurance that the mercenaries got their back. A potential opening line for the players is to ask about what happened to the chief. This is really open to roleplaying and I will leave it to \texttt{\textbf{MU/TH/UR}} to conduct the negotiations. 
     
    \texttt{\textbf{MU/TH/UR:}} Keep in mind that there are things that Weyland-Yutani are concerned about, specially if there are any eye-witnesses to the whole incident or if any traces can get back to them. This can presumably guarantee the safety of one or two players, but not the entire party. 
\end{rpg-commentbox}


\begin{rpg-commentbox}{Ambassator}
    All firefighters stay hidden and a single firefighter does the talking. \texttt{\textbf{MANIPULATION}} or \texttt{\textbf{COMMAND}} are potential skills applicable here.
    
    This can be played in several ways, but depending on which player does the talking they can double-cross the rest of the team if that guarantees their safety or they can even trigger the audio decoy and potentially sacrifice themselves to lure the alien to the mercenaries. 
     
    \texttt{\textbf{MU/TH/UR:}} You can decide to roll this off-scream, narrating it as you wish, or perhaps giving the mercenaries' character sheets to the players and letting them fight the alien instead.
\end{rpg-commentbox}


\section{Luring the alien}

\begin{rpg-commentbox}{}
   If the firefighters take a more stealthy  approach (\texttt{\textbf{MOBILITY}}), they can get to the entrance and spot the mercenaries (\texttt{\textbf{MANIPULATION}}) without being detected. Can they use their surroundings to lure the alien into the mercenaries and escape amidst the chaos?

   \texttt{\textbf{MU/TH/UR:}} Intersting items or things avaiable in the scene:


\begin{enumerate}
    \item two hospital stretchers that the firefighters can push into the of the corridor casing it to crash and make a loud enough bang sound (\texttt{\textbf{STRENGTH}});
    \item a small mechanical roomba (\texttt{\textbf{OBSERVATION}} to notice it) that the firefighters can program (\texttt{\textbf{COMM TECH}}) to go full speed into the corridor causing one of the mercenaries to startle and shot at it drawing the alien to them;
    \item If a firefighter stays behind in environmental control and succeeds in hiding from the alien (\texttt{\textbf{MOBILITY}}), they can use the system to turn-off all the emergy in the area. There will be a few seconds before the emergency grid comes online, firefighters can rush into the entrance (\texttt{\textbf{MOBILITY}}) as the mercenaries are caught by surprise.    
\end{enumerate}
\end{rpg-commentbox}

\clearpage

\begin{rpg-commentbox}{}
\begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{3}
    \item Who blinks first? A skilled technician can use environmental control and vent all the air from the facility (\texttt{\textbf{COMM TECH}} -2). The mercenaries and the firefighters will be trapped with the alien. It will be a matter of finding out who has enough air to not suffocate before the firefighters bring environmental control back online, and try to sneak out (\texttt{\textbf{STEALTH}} mode rules). 
\end{enumerate}
\end{rpg-commentbox}


\section{Alien Rampage}

\begin{rpg-commentbox}{}
    ``\textit{The audio decoys blasts with a loud sound. The alien falls down from an air duct in between the firefighters and the Weyland-Yutani mercenaries. The creature hisses and starts its rampage.}''

    \texttt{\textbf{MU/TH/UR:}} Roll for combat. It can be a challenging combat because you have to control 3 mercenaries plus the alien. To facilitate things, the alien will prioritize killing the mercenaries, especially because they are the ones with fire-power to take it down, so the alien considers them the biggest threat. Whenever the alien hits one of the mercenaries, they straight-up kill them. Use this to build tension, for example rolling the signature attacks in the open and reading one of the mercenaries deaths in the red box ahead. This will give the idea to the players that almost all the alien attacks are lethal. You can also use this to make the mercenaries' weapon fall or slide to a place where the firefighters can risk picking it-up. 
\end{rpg-commentbox}


\begin{rpg-warnbox}{Mercenaries' deaths}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Headbite --- The Xeno­morph opens its mouth wide and the inner jaws lash out killing them in one dreadful blow.
    \item Tailspike --- The tail impales the victim with terrible force.
    \item Crushing blow --- The Xeno­morph brings its entire weight down on the poor victim crushing its bones.
\end{enumerate}
 \end{rpg-warnbox}


\section{End of Act}

\begin{rpg-commentbox}{If firefighters succeed}
    \texttt{\textbf{MU/TH/UR:}} Narrate that firefighters escape the medical facility and lock the area behind them. After a couple days and lots of discussion with the people in the station, APOLLO detaches the medical facility and the fate of the alien or mercenaries trapped on it is unknown. Unsure how to continue with their lives after the incident, some firefighters plan to expose Weyland-Yutani while some others plan just to move as far as they can and start anew. 
    Ask for individual plans and add some dread twists to the players happy endings. 
    See suggestions below:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item I throw all the cheat into the dark-web ---
        ``\textit{A few days pass by and conspiracies start to arise. You always thought that once in the dark-web, something could never be completely shut-down. Slowly, all your connections refuse to speak with you or simply go ghost. It's late in the night and you shut your computer off to get some sleep when your vision goes black as you try to resist your kidnappers...}''

        \item I move to another space station ---
        ``\textit{You go to cryo sleep thinking that 6 months before getting into New Alaska or LV572 will be enough time to shut-off from all that has happened... A family member puts your name in the list of missing people as the ship that you were travellig into never made to its final destination.}''


        \item I continue as a firefighter --- ``\textit{It's been two months that you have been seeing a shrimp. You bring back the medical report floppy disk and input it into the system in hopes of getting reinstated. Soon two nurses sedate you. As your vision starts to fade, you read the system output: \texttt{mentally unstable.}}''
    \end{enumerate}
\end{rpg-commentbox}



\begin{rpg-commentbox}{If mercenaries succeed}
    \texttt{\textbf{MU/TH/UR:}} Narrate the pain of the paralyzing gel filling the firefighters' muscles. 
    The alien hisses but it also falls. Everything fades to black. Firefighters wake up in what appears to be a scientific facility. Wondering where they are, they hear the chief's screams of terror in the  distance --- ``\textit{Please! No! oh god.. please no... no... no... (sobbing)}'' (homage to Alien Labyrinth)
\end{rpg-commentbox}

\begin{rpg-commentbox}{If aliens kill everyone}
    \texttt{\textbf{MU/TH/UR:}} Narrate the dreads and horror as the alien captures victims and eventually ovomorph them. Soon the station is a full fledged hive and its inhabitants grovel in terror hoping to escape. There are echoes through the station corridors as survivors know that little by little the hive grows --- ``\textit{Please! No! oh god.. (alien sound)}''
\end{rpg-commentbox}
