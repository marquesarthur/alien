    The veteran firefighter in the crew. You grandfather was a firefighter, your father was a firefighter. You are a firefighter. It runs in the blood, but that doesn't mean that you are in the job for the joy of saving lives. Half the people in the station are just straight up idiots who are alive by the sole miracle of industrial/insurance companies doing the bare minimum so that the stupid people don't die and they have to pay for their stupidity. Well you get the idea.

    The paramedic of the crew. You are usually the one that bring the bad news that someone's limbs will need amputation but regardless, it's the only place where you can practice medicine. Besides, you get real pleasure in doing all the amputation/gore work. It's not like you won't accidentally kill one or two people with an overdose.
    Anywhere else, you would be flagged as a creep. Here, you transpire competence and whoever died in one of your shifts is just another junkie who is better of dead. Your competence speaks louder than these casualties.

        \item We can kill it! Jeopardize the efforts of your crew on trying to kill the alien. One example is to add NAPROLEVE in the extra air supply of your crew members so that they overdose while you escape.

\section{Anderson Rice}

\begin{rpg-pcbox}{Rice Anderson}{img/Rice-Anderson.png}
    You are still under probation. Trying to secure a job and provide for your family is your priority. A dedicated mormon, you want to use firefighting to connect to victims of accidents and put them in the path to salvation. Little you know that your faith will soon be put to test. \texttt{\textbf{IMPORTANT}} this is NOT a comical joke on a certain religion group but rather the idea of exploring faith in a horror setting.
