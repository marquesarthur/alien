\section{Where the hell is the body?}


\begin{rpg-commentbox}{The Alien}
   The creature controls the host to seek a dark and quiet place where it can grow stronger.

    On its path, it will infect two more prisoners (NPCs) making a larva exo-parasite grow on the host's stomach. 
    The larvas are in stealth mode and they need to infect a new host to reach stage II, i.e., exo-host.

\section{Escape plan}


\begin{rpg-commentbox}{Protect Kathia}
    Ideally, Kathia has left her corporate card in a biometric safe, so her protection is paramount to any escape plan.

    Mageed contacts prisoners via intercom and says that the crew is working on a escape plan. They will use Kathia's ship and for that, they need to bypass the lockdown.
    Prisoners are asked to gather enough mining explosives and bring them to the reactor core at the refinery. A handful of explosives can damage the reactor and cut power in the station, that will deactivate the lockdown. However, prisoners will need EVA suits as the air in the station will soon deplenish.

 \begin{rpg-commentbox}{Bring explosives to reactor}
    At this point in time, if one of the larvas is still alive and the PCs did not encounter it, people will hear agonizing screams as the larva infects a new host. 

    Something cool for this one is to have the host have a welding torch. The lava won't use it but it hangs in a loosely held bandolier making a lot of noise while the exo-parasite walks the refinery. This can make for some interesting scenes as for example, players setting the explosives in the reactor core while listening to the crackling sound of metal against the crate floor.

 \section{What is happening upstairs?}
 
 
 \begin{rpg-commentbox}{}
     From time to time Mageed gets in the intercom and give instructions.

     At some point, let him say hang-on, we got a situation here.

     All communications after this only return hiss static.
