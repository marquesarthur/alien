    The chief engineer of the station. This was supposed to be an one-year temporary job. One year turned into two, then into five. You would love to see the place collapse and get a job somewhere safer.

    Chief medic on the station. You live for your job and you actually believe in redemption. You decided to work at this place by choice and all the prisoners seem to understand that. If one person can walk freely in the prison block, that person is you.

    A pragmatic. You run the entire station making sure that prisoners don't kill each other (more than the necessary to blow steam off). You turn a blind-eye to people wrongly accused thinking that the few false positives justify all the greater good.

    Chief of security. You hate your job. You are trapped in this living hell with some of the worst scum of the sector. You would sacrifice each and every one for your personal survival.
