\section{Prisoners}


Why the prisoners don't just blow up the place? Well, truth to be told most of them are indeed terrorists and they have plans to either escape, gain control of the station as a new rendezvous point, or take revenge on both United Americas or  Weyland-Yutani. Let's just all accept any plausible excuses and have some fun playing RPG. 



\begin{rpg-commentbox}{Andy Myers}
    ``Kid'': a drug dealer. You have dwarfism and, over the years, you learned how to use this so that you passed unnoticed through marshals and law enforcement. 
\end{rpg-commentbox}

\begin{rpg-commentbox}{Fredy Cooperr}
    Officer: one of the most fearsome terrorists on anchor point station 2. You fought against corporate greed and blew several Weyland-Yutani installations before arrest. 
\end{rpg-commentbox}


\begin{rpg-commentbox}{Henrique Santiago}
    Smuggler: you trafficked people for organs extraction. It suffices to say that your lack any moral restraints.
\end{rpg-commentbox}

\begin{rpg-commentbox}{Hite Chyio}
    company agent: you were a Yakuza boss. You have blackmail information on several politicians and Weyland-Yutani. Kathia Rison is on her way to get you out of this hell. 
    
\end{rpg-commentbox}

\begin{rpg-commentbox}{Ivan Beschastnikh}
    marine: "dishonorably discharged" you do not talk about the reason why they threw you in this place either as a punishment worst than death or as a last favor. You are simply ruthless and think that in 3 to 6 months you will be back in the military under some black-ops team.
\end{rpg-commentbox}

\begin{rpg-commentbox}{Jone Heson}
    roughneck: you were wrongly accused for a crime you did not commit. You are a hardworking person and you had hopes that Weyland-Yutani lawyers would reach out and save you. Until then, you have to blend in and survive.
\end{rpg-commentbox}

\begin{rpg-commentbox}{Nolan Alder}
    scientist: a bio-terrorist. Before being caught, you left a sample of Chemical Agent A0-3959X.91â€“15 in a hidden stash. You plan to escape and launch a bio attack against anchor point station 2
\end{rpg-commentbox}

\section{Lasalle Bionational crew}

Disguised as Weyland-Yutani annual inspection crew, the Lasalle plans to rescue one of the prisoners who has valuable information against their competitors.

\begin{rpg-commentbox}{Aleki Bowma}
    marine: chief of security of the Lasalle Bionational crew
    
\end{rpg-commentbox}


\begin{rpg-commentbox}{Barby Lopez}
    pilot: you brought Kathia on her corporate mission though you know the fame of Pallas and had you had the opportunity, you wouldn't think twice about shutting down the place
    
\end{rpg-commentbox}


\begin{rpg-commentbox}{Kathia Rison}
    , company agent: on your way to extract Hite from Pallas and get the hell out of this god forsaken place
    
\end{rpg-commentbox}


\begin{rpg-commentbox}{Tery Marte}
    roughneck reporter: an activist, you have a hidden camera in your right arm and you falsified paperwork to present yourself as a psychologist. You plan to evaluate the prisoners as an excuse to get first hand data on Pallas and use that for blackmailing or to shut the place down

\begin{rpg-commentbox}{Abdul Mageed}
    colonial marshal: a pragmatic. You run the entire station making sure that prisoners don't kill each other (more than the necessary to blow steam off). You turn a blind-eye to people wrongly accused thinking that the few false positives justify all the greater good.
