\chapter{Act III}





\begin{rpg-commentbox}{}
    
    Things upstair might have gone south. Even though the crew has side-arms, and a weapons-locker, the creature over took them by surprise. In fact, the alien at this act is at its full potential, stage III.

    ``Red lights flash through the hangar. There is blood everywhere and disembodied members. Green goo merges itself with recognizable human blood and the silence is only broken by heavy footsteps of something too large walking in the hangar bay...''.

\begin{rpg-commentbox}{Let's get the hell out of here}
   The PCs must fetch the corporate card at the safe on the crew quarters. \textbf{mobility} vs \textbf{observation}

   When they reach the safe, they discover that it has been cracked open and the card is not there.

   \medskip

    The players might also want to grab side arms or heavy weapons at the weapons locker. For the heavy weapons, they need Mageed's card.
    Mageed is not found anywhere.
\end{rpg-commentbox}



\begin{rpg-commentbox}{What happened here?}
    If players decide to view the logs in the mainframe, they discover that part of the crew has locked themselves in the space shuttle and are waiting 
    for the prisoners to blow the hatch so they can escape instead. The prisoners can radio communicate with any survivors in the ship \textbf{manipulation} \textbf{command}

    For this to work, there has to be something in favor of the players, e.g., all pilots are dead and the only person with piloting skills is among the players; in desperation to escape the crew forgot to open some magnetic grips attached to the ship due to security protocols of the hangar. \textbf{heavy machinery}

    Make all negotiations stressful while the alien havocs/or camly walks through the hangar. If players take too long, the Praetorian will produce exo-parasites (Stage I alien) and drop them on the station so they can hunt new hosts.
 \end{rpg-commentbox}

 
\begin{rpg-commentbox}{Do we really need to kill this thing?}
    Players may get clever and crawl through the ducts and put an explosive on the hangar door sucking the the alien out of the station; use some of the heavy weapons and diversions to not confront the creature directly, etc.

    Reward clever thinking but punish time lost if decisions are not made fast enough. For example, if there is too much discussion, have a stage I alien jump from a duct and try to attach itself to one of the talkative players.

\begin{rpg-commentbox}{Final showdown}
    Run how the players open the hangar door and negotiate with the Kohru crew. Combat may take a while, and this is intended to be a short one-shot, so tweek the alien stats if need be. Remember that act 3 has the resolution of many personal and conflicting agendas!

\begin{rpg-commentbox}{End of Act}
    \textbf{Act 3 ends with the players' escape or death.}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Will Lasalle send a crew to gather alien DNA before word spreads out?
    \item Will the reporter release footage of his recordings or blackmail someone?
    \item Do the prisoners take control of the ship or are they out-matched by the surviving crew?

    \textbf{Narrate the epilogue and thank everyone for their time.}
