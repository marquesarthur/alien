\begin{rpg-commentbox}{Exo-host}
    The parasite has taken full control of its host. Its spider like legs have doubled in length now serving as powerful defensive appendages able to impale any human being. At this stage, it starts producing spores that it can inject into new hosts through its leg stings.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item HYPNOTIZING GAZE: The decomposing eyes of the host stare deeply into the soul of its
        victim. The victim is mesmerized by the dread of such a beast. They stand in awe of
        what nature, or god, or the devil has created, get +1 STRESS LEVEL and must make an immediate Panic Roll.

        \par\noindent\rule{.9\textwidth}{0.4pt}
        
        \item  ASSESSING THE THREAT: The host pauses, hissing quietly but all the more threatening
        for that. It looks like itâ€™s thinking, 
        or maybe giving silent orders to unseen companions. Everyone within MEDIUM range gets +1 STRESS LEVEL.

        \par\noindent\rule{.9\textwidth}{0.4pt}

        \item PLAYING WITH ITS PREY: The host attacks, but not to kill. The target is knocked to the ground
        and drops all hand-held items, but otherwise takes no damage. The host stands over
        them, taunting its prey to run so the game can go on. The victim gets +1 STRESS LEVEL and
        must make an immediate Panic Roll.
        
        \par\noindent\rule{.9\textwidth}{0.4pt}

        \item ALL-OUT ATTACK: The host launches into a wild attack, throwing every one of its sting legs at its victim. It attacks with ten Base Dice, Damage 1. If the victim takes damage, it is infected with a disease with Virulence 6.

        \par\noindent\rule{.9\textwidth}{0.4pt}

        \item READY TO KILL: The host grabs its victim, its parasite stings poised to strike. Roll for the
        attack with ten Base Dice. If it hits, the victim counts as grabbed (see page 93) and needs to
        make an opposed CLOSE COMBAT roll against ten Base Dice to break loose. The victim and all
        friendly characters in the same zone must make Panic Rolls. Unless the victim breaks free,
        the host will use a STINGER APPENDAGE attack against them on its next initiative.

        \par\noindent\rule{.9\textwidth}{0.4pt}


        \item STINGER APPENDAGE: The host's deadly appendages leans out,
        gnashing in anticipation before snapping forwards. The attack has a strength of nine Base
        Dice, Damage 2. If it causes any damage it automatically inflicts critical injury \#64, killing
        the victim in one dreadful blow.
